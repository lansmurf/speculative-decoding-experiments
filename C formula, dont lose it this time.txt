def calculate_c_value(p, q):
    """
    Calculate the C value based on the probabilities p and q.

    The C value combines the agreement (absolute difference) and confidence (average probability) 
    of the predictions from two models.

    Args:
    p (float): Probability from the first model.
    q (float): Probability from the second model.

    Returns:
    float: The calculated C value.
    """

    # Calculate the base confidence as the average of p and q
    base_confidence = (p + q) / 2

    # Adjust the confidence based on the agreement (absolute difference)
    adjusted_confidence = base_confidence * (1 - abs(p - q))

    # The C value could be simply the adjusted confidence, or further adjustments can be made
    # For simplicity, here we return the adjusted confidence as the C value
    return adjusted_confidence


I ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT GEOMETRIC DECAY FOR THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE SINCE THE CLOSER THE TOKEN IS TO THE START, THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS


def calculate_c_value_weighted(p, q, weight_p):
    """
    Calculate the C value using a weighted average to give more importance to probability p.

    Args:
    p (float): Probability from the better model.
    q (float): Probability from the smaller model.
    weight_p (float): Weight indicating the importance of p over q.

    Returns:
    float: The calculated C value.
    """

    # Calculate the base confidence as a weighted average of p and q
    base_confidence = weight_p * p + (1 - weight_p) * q

    # Adjust the confidence based on the agreement (absolute difference)
    adjusted_confidence = base_confidence * (1 - abs(p - q))

    return adjusted_confidence



set up a heuristic like:

base_confidence = weight_p * p + (1 - weight_p) * q
whatever = base_confidence * (1 - abs(p - q))

where p and q are big and small probs, weight_p is whatever importance you wanna give to p

that is for every token right, so you calc average and variance for the entire seq. high enough avg and low var means seq could be "fixed"
